1. Make sure your main repo is clean
> git status

git status

2. Create worktree for branch-A, Create the branch from main, and create a folder for it:
> git worktree add -b branch-A ../branch-A main

Translate: create/add a worktree call branch-A at a folder call /branch-A. The branch is created from 'main' branch

3. Refer to 2.
> git worktree add -b branch-B ../branch-B main

4. Go to the directory
> cd ../branch-B 


5. Open branch-A in vs code
> code ../branch-A
> code ../branch-B



5. Work normally in a worktree
git add .
git commit -m "<your message>"
git push origin branch-A   # or branch-B


6. Remove worktree when done (optional)
> git worktree remove ../branch-A
> git worktree remove ../branch-B

Reminder:
Reopen vscode to work in new worktree.
Changing worktree in terminal doesn't bring you to another worktree
